== Introduction

This project is focused on bringing a minimal http://github.com/openshift/origin[OpenShift 4.0 or newer] cluster to your local laptop or desktop computer. 

If you are looking for a solution for running OpenShift 3.x, you will need tools such as `oc cluster up`, http://github.com/minishift/minishift[Minishift] or https://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/overview/[CDK].

Currently only alpha releases are available.
